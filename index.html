            Dr. Ahmed Abdulkareem has been my mentor since about 15 years ago. He has always been a man with a listening ear, an open-minded fellow, and a sincere gentleman. 
<br>
He is outspoken and that helped a lot of us get things right with his word of encouragement and his special guidance skill. He used to make us see why we need to review our options and be optimistic about our aims. He has mentored, coached, and nurtured a number of us. Now, we are happy he was there to watch us grow. Growing up around him was fun and challenging, and most especially it gave us hope.
